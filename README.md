# 381assignment2

Instructions on the installation of R, Rstudio, etc can be found here:

https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/content/75904/viewContent/694287/View

Once you have everything installed, here is how you get started on assignment 1.

    go to https://github.com/rpmartin/381assignment2

    click on the green button labelled code.

    click on the clipboard icon to copy address to clipboard (the icon is to the right of the text box.)

    open Rstudio.

    click on File in the top menu bar, then New Project, then Version Control, then Git.

    Where it asks for Repository URL paste (control V) from your clipboard (this should be what you copied from step 3)

    R chooses the name of the folder in which you will be working, but you should choose where you want this folder saved.

    Click Create Project and Rstudio will start in this folder, and all the files you need have been cloned into this folder from github.

    Open file assignment2.R

    Ensure that your cursor is at the top of the file assignment2.R (the file is open in the top-left box in Rstudio). Run the code by repeatedly hitting both control and enter. By doing so you step through the code line by line, and in the bottom left panel you see the results of each line of code. The last line of code creates your first graph, which should show up in the bottom right panel.

    There should be no errors (yet ;) when you run the code of assignment2.R. If there are errors, do not proceed further! Get in touch either by email or on the message board. Only once you have checked that there are no errors in your assignment2.R file should you open up assignment2.Rmd file.

    In the assignment2.Rmd file enter your name and student ID at the top, and "sign" your academic integrity statement (replace name here with your name).

    Knit your assignment2.Rmd file by hitting the knit button (there is a ball of yarn with a needle sticking out of it beside the word knit). This is called knitting because we are "weaving" together R code (that produces graphs and tables) and prose.

    A new window should open with your assignment... you are on your way!

    For written answers, simply write words under the questions in the assignment2.Rmd file.

    For graphs, you create and name the graph in your assignment2.R file. Check frequently to make sure your assignment2.R file still runs without errors. Only once you have made sure there are no errrors in assignment2.R save it to DISK. (your Rmd file can't utilize what isn't saved to disk e.g. the unsaved code in your editor or even objects in your current environment.)

    Embed the objects in the assignment2.Rmd file by name, and knit to see the results.

Let me know if you have any issues, I am here to help! Cheers,
